# List, tuples, and sets
## this coding exercies requires you to complete three steps:
# 1. Create a list, called `my_list`, with three elements. The total of the numbers added together should be 100.
# 2. Create a tuple, called `my_tuple`, with a single value in it.
# 3. Modify the variable `set2` so that set1.intersections(set2) returns {5, 77, 9,12}

# 1.
my_list = [33, 33, 34]

# 2.
my_tuple = (15,)  # Note the comma after the value

# 3.
set1 = {14, 5, 9, 31, 12, 77, 67, 8}
set2 = {5, 9, 12, 77}
